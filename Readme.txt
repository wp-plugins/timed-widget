A plugin for displaying different content on your site at different times of day.

== Description ==

The Timed Widget WordPress plugin provides a widget which can display different content at different times of day. For example, suppose you have a WordPress site for your radio station, and you want to display a badge that changes as the different shows come on the air. The Timed Widget plugin provides a way to set up a schedule for your shows, and display different images at different times.

The Timed Widget plugin allows you to create CodeBlocks, which are snippets of text or HTML that you want to display (just like the Text widget in WordPress). You can then create a schedule, which is made up of TimeSlots. Each TimeSlot is associated with a CodeBlock, and gives a time of day to appear (say, 8:00 am to 11:00 am), a range of dates to appear during (July 27th – September 5th) and the days of the week to appear on (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). So, whichever CodeBlock is associated with this TimeSlot will appear on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays from 8:00 to 11:00 between the dates of July 27th and September 5th.
